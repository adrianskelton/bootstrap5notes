# Bootstrap 5 Readme

## Introduction
Welcome to my README for Bootstrap 5! During a recent hackathon I realised once again how powerful bootstrap can be for the quick design and setup for a website. So what better way to dig deeper and relearn commands than to write a tutorial for all to share.

## What is Bootstrap?
Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites and web applications. It provides a collection of pre-designed CSS styles, JavaScript plugins, and reusable components that can be easily customized and integrated into your projects.

## Tips before starting

Open your favorite code editor, I would suggest vscode and then you can follow along and test the code yourself in vscode. \
[Download VSCode here in case you don't have it](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## Getting Started
To get started with Bootstrap 5, you can include the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML code, or you can use package managers like npm or yarn to install Bootstrap and its dependencies.

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
           <!-- Include Bootstrap CSS -->
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<!-- Include Bootstrap JavaScript -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```
